      <v-expansion-panel-header>1.  Read this post in its entirity (especially this section).</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        If you get caught doing something that’s not allowed, “being ignorant of the rules” is not a valid excuse. You WILL get punished for your transgressions.      </v-expansion-panel-content>

      <v-expansion-panel-header>2.  Respect other players.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
All members of the community shall show utmost respect towards each other, regardless of age, gender, nationality, or creed, whether in-game, or outside of it. We are called a community for a reason.    </v-expansion-panel-content>

      <v-expansion-panel-header>3.  Do NOT be an asshole.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
Your right to have fun ends when the enjoyment of others is being affected because of your antics. You shall not, under any circumstances, do anything that causes harm or causes debilitation to a fellow player in-game, including, but not limited to: throwing explosive ordnance within close proximity to fellow player(s), handcuffing teammate(s), running over player(s) with a vehicle, shooting someone’s in-game character with a firearm in any part of their body.

      <v-expansion-panel-header>4.  As much as possible, commit yourself to the game.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Note that this only applies to major curated games (usually weekend missions), especially when deciding to play a role with limited availability within the platoon (i.e. Medic, FTL, SQL). If you are unsure whether or not you can see the current session to the end, it is highly encouraged that you choose an easily replaceable role to play as in the game (i.e. Rifleman, Ammo Bearer, etc.).

      <v-expansion-panel-header>5.  Tasteless remarks will NOT be tolerated.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        There shall be no cat-calling, verbal harassment, or attack of personal character towards any members of the group, and there shall be no shaming of people with a preferred sexual orientation. Racist/Sexist/Derogatory slur against any member of the community will be met with the appropriate punishment immediately. Know the difference between poking a little bit of fun and being downright offensive.        </v-expansion-panel-content>

      <v-expansion-panel-header>6.  Everyone wants (and deserves) to have a good gaming experience.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Thus, avoid causing problems to the server by loading mods that are not indicated in the group’s mod list.

      <v-expansion-panel-header>7.  DO NOT reveal the TeamSpeak details and server IP address in public.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        For strict compliance.  Our teamspeak server is only restricted to members and recruits.  Anyone beyond that will be IP banned.

    <v-expansion-panel class="grey darken-3 white--text">
      <v-expansion-panel-header>8.  Strictly NO posts about selling, unwarranted solicitations, or transactions of any kind between members that involve real money.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Self-explanatory. This is a gaming community, not a goddamn marketplace.</v-expansion-panel-content>

      <v-expansion-panel-header>9.  Admins and Moderators reserve the right to kick, ban, or otherwise suspend individuals exhibiting bad conduct in the community.</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        These roles do not exist for nothing, they are implemented to keep the peace, and to ensure that no act of desecration towards the group and any of its members goes unpunished.

        Have fun, that’s the most important part. Never forget why we come together and play this game in the first place.
